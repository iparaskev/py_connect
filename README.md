py_connect
===============================

A library for modelling devices and their connections in the physical 
world and controlling them in the virtual world through auto generated 
source code for the raspberry pi. 

py_connect provides a DSL (Domain Specific Language) for defining devices 
and connections between them. The DSL has been built using 
[textx](https://github.com/textX/textX) and through custom parsers the 
defined models are translated to ecore models using 
[pyecore](https://github.com/pyecore/pyecore).

Usage
-----
```
usage: py_connect [-h] [--device DEVICE] [--store] [--xmi] 
                  [--xmi_path XMI_PATH] [--db_path DB_PATH] 
		  [--connections CONNECTIONS] [--source] 
		  [--schematic] [--specific_con SPECIFIC_CON]
                  [--update_pidevices]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --device DEVICE       Path to a device specification.
  --store               Move device specification to db.
  --xmi                 Export xmi.
  --xmi_path XMI_PATH   Folder for saving xmi files.
  --db_path DB_PATH     Path to custom devices db.
  --connections CONNECTIONS
                        Path to a connection specification.
  --source              Flag for generating source code.
  --schematic           Flag for generating schematics images.
  --specific_con SPECIFIC_CON
                        The name of the specific connection.
  --update_pidevices    Update pidevices implementations.
```

How It Works
------------

### Syntax

Assingment is declared by the character ":". An entity precedes the ":" 
and it's value follows. An entity has attributes, which could be 
single valued or other entities.
For example the definition of a device's name is done in a single line
`name: raspberry_pi`, but the device's memory is defined like this
```
 memory:
  ram: 2 gb
  rom: 16 gb
```

Some attributes' value is a list of other entities. A list entry is defined 
by "-" followed by it's value. For example the pins of a device are defined by
```
pins: 
  - power:
    name: power_5v_1
    number: 2
    type: 5v
  - io_digital: -> both, sda-1
	  name: bcm_2
	  number: 3
```

#### Device definition

A device could be either a peripheral device 
(sensor/actuator) or a board (raspberry pi). 
The following table contains all the attributes 
and their values
that define a device and whether they are 
mandatory or not for a valid definition.

  Attribute | Board | Peripheral | Mandatory | Value
  --------- | ----- | ---------- | --------- | -----
  name | x | x | x | string
  vcc | x | x | x | number
  operating_voltage | x | x | x | number
  pins | x | x | x | \[pin entities\]
  network | x | x | - | \[network entities\]
  bluetooth | x | x | - | bluetooth entity
  type | - | x | x | "sensor" or "actuator"
  memory | x | - | x | memory entity
  timer | x | - | x | bool
  os | x | - | x | "raspbian"
  cpu | x | - | x | cpu entity
  rtc | x | - | - | bool
  battery | x | - | - | bool
  dma | x | - | - | bool
  

#### Connection definition
A connection between two devices is defined
by the connection of their hardware interfaces ports and of their power
pins.

### M2M
After the definations, m2t transormations are being applied on the 
generated models in order to transform them to ecore models. 

### Code generation

Currently only devices connected to the raspberry pi are supported. The 
control of the devices is being done through the 
[pidevices](https://github.com/iparaskev/pidevices) library. 

After the definition of the devices and their connection has been done
the source code could be generated by
```
$ py_connect --db_path devices --connections connection.cd --source
```
Where db_path is the path to the devices folder and connection.cd is 
the file, which contains the defined connections. The result of the 
command is python file named by the connection name.
